ImageKit Demo
=============

Simple demo to exercise ImageKit's ImageBrowserView.

While it is largely unrecognizable from the source, this code was inspired by and modeled after step 1 of Apple's ImageKit Demo.

This demo illustrates:

* IKImageBrowserView
* IKImageBrowserDataSource
* IKImageBrowserItem
* drag and drop support
	
Instructions
------------

* Drag images (or PDFs, etc) around the browser view to re-organize.
* Enter search text to filter the images displayed.
* Add images with a file browser.
* Drag and drop images from Finder, iPhoto, etc.
* Load images from files, folders, or urls. 
* Dragging a folder will add all files in that folder.
* Events for double click, right click etc. are wired up, but only print notices to the console.
