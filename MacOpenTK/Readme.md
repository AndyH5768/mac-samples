# MacOpenTK

OpenTK (The Open Toolkit) is an advanced, low-level C# library that makes working with OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL easier. OpenTK can be used for games, scientific applications or other projects that require 3D graphics, audio or computational functionality. This example gives a brief introduction to using OpenTK in a Xamarin.Mac app.

This sample creates a Game View, attaches it to the Main Window of the app and uses the Game View to render a simple triangle.

For more information on OpenTK and how to use it, please see [The Open Toolkit](http://www.opentk.com) website.
