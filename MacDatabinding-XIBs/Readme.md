# MacDatabinding XIBs in Xamarin.Mac

> [!NOTE]
> This method of working with controls and Data Binding has been deprecated, please see the **MacDatabinding-Storyboard** or **MacCollectionNew** samples instead.

Source code for the [Data Binding and Key-Value Coding](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/mac/app-fundamentals/databinding) documentation on [Xamarin Documentation](http://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin)

This project covers working with Data Binding and Key-Value Coding in a Xamarin.Mac application (using `.xib` files) from simple control binding to Table View & Outlines and finally covers Collection Views (`NSCollectionView`).
