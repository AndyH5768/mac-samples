# MacCopyPaste

This sample covers working with the Pasteboard (`NSPasteboard`) to provide **Cut**, **Copy** and **Paste** operations in a Xamarin.Mac application. It shows how to work with standard data types that can be shared between multiple apps and how to support custom data within a give app.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample currently contains a workaround to [Bugzilla Defect #31760](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=31760). When the version of Xamarin.Mac is released that fixes this issue, this sample will be updated to the correct version. The correct source code has been included as a reference.
