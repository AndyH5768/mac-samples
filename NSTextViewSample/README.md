NSTextAttachmentCell
====================

This sample demonstrates how to use the default `NSTextAttachmentCell` with
an NSImage and how to subclass `NSTextAttachmentCell` to perform custom
cell sizing and rendering.

The sample application, Catpad, uses the custom cells with random images of
cats displayed for editing inside `NSTextView`.
