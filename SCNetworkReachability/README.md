SCNetworkReachability
=====================

The `NetworkReachability` programming interface allows an application to determine the status of a system's current network configuration and the reachability of a target host. A remote host is considered reachable when a data packet, sent by an application into the network stack, can leave the
local device. Reachability does not guarantee that the data packet will actually be received by the host.

The `NetworkReachability` programming interface supports a synchronous and an asynchronous model. In the synchronous model, you get the reachability status by calling the `TryGetFlags` function. In the asynchronous model, you can schedule the `NetworkReachability` object on the `CFRunLoop` of a client
objectâ€™s thread. The client implements a callback function (`SetNotification`) to receive notifications when the reachability status of a given remote host changes.
