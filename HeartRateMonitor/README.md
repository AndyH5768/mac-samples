# HeartRateMonitor with Xamarin.Mac

The `CoreBluetooth` framework provides the classes needed for your iOS and Mac apps to communicate with devices that are equipped with Bluetooth low energy wireless technology, such as heart rate monitors, cycling cadence sensors, and temperature monitors.

This sample demonstrates: discovering, connecting to, and retrieving heart rate data from Bluetooth LE heart rate monitors.

It shows the location of the monitor (chest, wrist, foot, etc.), the current heart rate in beats per minute, and animates a heart beating at the same speed reported by the connected device.
