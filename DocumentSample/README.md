# DocumentSample

Shows how to create a Document-based application.

Document-based applications are supported by the `NSDocument` family of classes and take a lot of the repetitive work of creating a multi-document application out of the user hands.

They take care of loading, saving, creating new instances and closing of windows for you.

In addition to this sample, there is a template in Xamarin Studio that will create the basics for you.
